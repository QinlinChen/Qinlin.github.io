## About

I received my B.S. degree in computer science and technology from Nanjing University in 2020, and I am studying for a Ph.D. degree in the [Pascal Research Group](https://pascal-group.bitbucket.io/) at Nanjing University. I am supervised by [Yue Li](https://yuelee.bitbucket.io/) (李樾). I have my interest in programming languages, software reliability methods, and distributed systems.
