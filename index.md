## About

I received my B.S. degree in computer science and technology from Nanjing University in 2020, and I am studying for a M.Sc. degree in [SPAR Group](http://ics.nju.edu.cn/spar/), Institute of Computer Software, Nanjing University. I am supervised by [Yanyan Jiang](http://ics.nju.edu.cn/~jyy/). I have my interests in systems (i.e. OS, DB, and distributed systems) and software reliability methods (i.e. testing, analysis, and formal methods).
